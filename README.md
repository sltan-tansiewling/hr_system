# HR System
Allows you to apply and track your leave application

#### Proto Persona

Name:       Me

Bio:        Employee of a company that does not have a HR system

Stories:    1. To apply for leave, staff needs to send for approval via email.
            2. Approval emails will also be sent back to applicant via email.
            3. Staff needs to trace back to leave approval emails to calculate leave balance.

Pain Points:Inefficient way because emails get too many and may be overlooked.

Needs:      To have a central place to see status of leave applications and balance leave

#### Problem Statement

Employees need a quick and easy way to apply and track their leave applications so that they do not have to look through their emails and track manually in Excel.
